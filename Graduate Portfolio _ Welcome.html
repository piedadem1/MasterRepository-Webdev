					<h3>HTML 5 &amp; CSS 3</h3>
					<p>HTML 5: The use of HTML 5 has a better web standard than the previous versions. This has resulted in; HTMLs' ability to load faster, improve performance, use less bandwidth, and allow batteries to last longer on devices. CSS 3 is the latest evolution of the Cascading style sheets language which was published in June of 2011. CSS is used in describing the presentation of Websites, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows the site to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as Desktops, Laptops or Ipads, or even printers. What makes CSS 3 great? CSS 3 uses the properties of CSS and developed them to include new features to provide ease of use to the designers. CSS 3 allows the designer to handle media queries and is capable of supporting responsive designs. CSS was proposed by Hakon Wium Lie who was working with Tim Berners-Lee(Founder of HTML).
